# TareTark Project
[taretark.netlify.app/](taretark.netlify.app/)
## Introduction

This is a website for my jointly ran short-term accommodation business. It aims to showcase available services and enable instant booking. It's an **unfinished project** and at some point I'll most likely **rewrite** it in Nuxt.

## Purpose

Other than being a business necessity, I started this project to get some initial experience with a JS framework. As I found Mantine UI to be quite appealing, I chose to go with React. I also wanted to see how routing and internationalization works. I planned to integrate the Stripe and Booking API together, so website visitors could instantly book an available property.

## Technologies Used
- Mantine UI
- React w/ Typescript
